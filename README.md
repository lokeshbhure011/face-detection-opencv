# face-detection-opencv
This project demonstrates real-time face detection using Python, OpenCV, and a Haar Cascade classifier. It captures live video from a webcam, detects human faces, and highlights them with bounding boxes. The project is beginner-friendly and helps understand the basics of computer vision and object detection.
